function anomalyScore = compute_active_cells (sdr)
% Given the input (sdr), this function (i) computes the active cells in the sequence memory array,
% basically, all predicted cell in an active column (column with 1 as input) is active.
% and all cells in an active column with no predicted cells are active; (ii) marks the appropriate
% cells for future learning using the SM.learnFlag tag array, and (iii) outputs an anomaly score.
%
% The anomalyScore computation is based on description at
% https://github.com/numenta/nupic/wiki/Anomaly-Detection-and-Anomaly-Scores
% using actual predictions rather than "confidences" as stated on the
% website. (NOTE: I am not sure what column "confidences" mean -- FUTURE MODIFICATION)

%% The following has NOT been implemented

% At the beginning of a sequence we stay in "Pay Attention Mode" for a number of timesteps (relevant parameter: pamLength)
% When we are in PAM, we do not burst unpredicted columns during learning
% If new sequence, turn on "start cell" (the first one) for every active column
%
%   1.  If new sequence, turn on "start cell" (the first one) for every active column
%   2.  Otherwise, turn on any predicted cells in every active column
%   3.  If no predicted cells in a column, turn on every cell in the column

% The following uses the tip at http://floybix.github.io/2016/07/01/attempting-nab
% Instead of the raw bursting rate, a delta anomaly score was calculated:
% it considers only newly active columns (ignoring any remaining active from the previous timestep).
% The bursting rate is calculated only within these new columns. To handle small changes,
% the number of columns considered ? i.e. divided by ? is kept from falling below 20% of the total number
% of active columns (20% of 40 = 8).
% (number-of-newly-active-columns-that-are-bursting) /
% max(0.2 * number-of-active-columns, number-of-newly-active-columns)
